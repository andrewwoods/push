# Road Map

Collect feature ideas to mostly help with near term development. This will also
help keep track of potential ideas. I'm not necessarily committing to
implementing all of these ideas. As I get more committed to the idea of
building out a particular feature, I'll convert the item to an issue, in my
chosen issue tracker.
