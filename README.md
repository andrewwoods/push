__Personal URL Shortener__

It's nice to have URLs that are easy to pass around on social media and via
email. People are growing ever more distrustful of populate services like
bit.ly, goo.gl, and tinyurl. So, I'm creating this to have a privacy-respecting
alternative. 



## Version

The current version is 0.0.0. This project uses [semantic versioning](http://semver.org).


## Features

* Remove tracking information before saving the URL
* Use a custom alias (Up to 16 characters)
* Unfurl other tracking service URLs; Add option to re-shorten and save it

## Questions

* Do I want to deal with mulitple users?
* Do I want to (Can I) manage this as a open source project?
* What Domain Name do I want to use for my short links? Thinking awoods.info

## Ideas for sections/pages

* Language Translations 
* Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
* Screenshots
* Submit Issues
